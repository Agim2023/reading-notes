Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means. - it provides greater control over alignment and space distribution between items within a container.
Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis. - The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns. If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.
How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility? - Certain properties can impact accessibility by having hidden elements while keeping them accessible

What are some advantages of using flexbox over float? ~Instead of using a float to create layouts by floating elements to the left or the right, flexbox allows you to create layouts by aligning items to a single axis. The axis can be horizontal or vertical. It is best used for distributing space for items in the same axis.
