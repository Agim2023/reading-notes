What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components? ~The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program.
What does What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? ~Building a static version means to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity.
Once you Once you have a static application, what do you need to add? ~You will need to build components that reuse other components and pass data using the 'props' method.
What are What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? ~Does the data affects the behavior of the components?, ~does it remain unchanged overtime?, ~Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component?
How can you identify where state needs to live? ~You identify every component that renders something based on that state. Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent. If you can't find a component where it makes sense to won the state, you just create a new component solely for holding the state and adding it in the hierarchy above the common parent component.

What is a “higher-order function”? ~Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing? ~the second line shows what would be returned after invoking the function in code.
Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions. ~The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. Reduce builds a value by repeatedly taking one element from the array and combining it with the current value.
