In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = These status codes are informative; they inform the client that the initial portion of a request has been received. 
200’s = These are the codes for success. These inform the customer that their request was granted. 
300’s = The redirection codes are as follows. These inform the client that the resource is no longer available where it was anticipated.
400’s = The client error codes are listed here. When a client sends a server an incorrect request, this occurs.
500’s = These are the error codes for the server. They frequently signal issues with a service that is overloaded and may be temporary or permanent.
What is a status code 202? ~A status 202 code informs the client that the request was valid, but processing takes place later.
What is a status code 308? ~a persistent redirect instructs the client to access the resource using a different URL rather than the one they are currently using.
What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client? ~No Content error code 204.
What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does? ~a code 410 Gone.
What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code? ~In this code, the client has not yet granted itself permission to visit the backend, but the server might do so later.

Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env? ~It's for the coding's security.

What does the /:id mean in a route? ~It suggests that a portion of the URL is used as a stand-in for a value.

How do you make a default value in a schema? ~Using mongoose, you can set the property within the schema's definition of the field.
What does a 500 error status code mean? ~It is a general error message that doesn't explain what specifically went wrong.
What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201? ~If you receive a status code of 200, it means that the server has successfully processed the client's request. A status code of 201 denotes a successful request and the creation of a new resource.
