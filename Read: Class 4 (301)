What is a ‘Controlled Component’? ~Controlled components are components that have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component.
Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why. ~We should update the data as soon as the user enters to pervent any data loss in the event of a system shutdown or system update.
How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? ~We target what the user is entering with this.Setstate tag.

Why would we use a ternary operator? ~Using a ternary operator would help reduce the amount of coding being used.
Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement: if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
~ if (condition ) {
    value if true;
  } else {
    value if false;
  }
